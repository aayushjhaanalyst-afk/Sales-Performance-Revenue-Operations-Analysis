# Sales Performance & Revenue Operations Analysis

> **“The sales team was busy every month — but no one could explain why revenue wasn’t moving.”**

**Domain:** B2B Construction / Building Materials  
**Time Period:** Nov-Dec 2025

## Overview

This project is a **diagnostic analysis of sales performance** built to answer a simple but uncomfortable question:

**If sales activity is consistent, why is revenue unpredictable?**

Using real operational data, the analysis focuses on identifying **where measurement breaks down across the sales process** and how those gaps prevent informed decision-making.

Rather than forcing incomplete datasets together, **data quality and linkage issues were treated as first-class analytical findings**.

---

## Business Context

Sales activity looked healthy on the surface:

- Regular monthly meetings  
- Engagement across multiple regions  
- A sizeable pipeline on paper  

Yet leadership could not reliably answer:

- Which activities actually move deals forward?  
- Are priority accounts receiving proportional effort?  
- Why do deals stay stuck for extended periods?  
- What is learned when deals are lost?  

This analysis was designed to **make those blind spots visible**.

---

## Data Used

Four independent operational datasets were reviewed:

1. Time and effort tracking across customer accounts  
2. Key (VIP) account list with revenue targets  
3. Meeting activity logs  
4. Sales pipeline and inquiry tracker  

A **critical discovery** was that these datasets were **poorly connected**, severely limiting performance visibility.

## Key Findings

- Only **19% of key accounts** could be linked to recorded sales effort  
- **66% of meeting time** had no defined activity type  
- **₹132M** of pipeline value remained in review stages for over **one year**  
- Average deal cycle exceeded **400 days**, far above industry norms  
- **No loss reasons** were documented for failed deals  
- Fewer than **5% of activities** could be traced to pipeline movement  

**Core insight:**  
The problem was not lack of effort — it was **lack of measurable execution**.

---

## Analysis Performed

- Activity and time allocation analysis  
- Key account coverage assessment  
- Pipeline aging and stage concentration analysis  
- Revenue-at-risk estimation  
- Data quality and linkage diagnostics  

Data was **never force-merged** where identifiers were unreliable.

---

## Tools & Approach

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- Spreadsheet validation  
- Business-driven KPI design  
- Industry benchmarking  

The focus remained on building **insight that supports decisions**, not dashboards for appearance.

## Why This Project Matters

Sales problems are often framed as **performance issues**.  
This project demonstrates that many originate from **measurement and process design failures**.

> **Clear data structure enables clarity in execution.**
